# ServoBot
A basic bot for discord server. Still WIP and can probably be improved adding other functions

This bot requires various libs to run, apart from (of course) node.js and discord.js you'll also need nodemon
also for your own uses you have to put your own bot token in the settings.json file but that should be obvious.... i hope
